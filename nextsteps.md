# Next Steps

<br>

The next steps for our project are to continue improving out model and test our model on different data. Our model is certainly not perfect, so there is always more to be done. It may be useful to train our model on different data to try and reduce bias of the training data we were originally given.

# Challenges

<br>

There are several challenges that our model could face when implemented in the real world. The first is that networks are typically not very homogenous. For example, the network of Rice students with two people being connected if they know each other contains many groupings where people are more likely to know each other than two random people. These would have to be accounted for. Second, our model generally overpredicts the number of connections a page has. We may attempt to reduce this, but this could potentially result in underpredicting the connections a page has.
