## Abstract

**Data set**: The dataset is a network, represented as a graph, from a social media website. Each node, represented by a number id, is a page from that website, and an edge exists between two nodes if both pages link to each other. In addition, we have provided the page’s description and the page type.

**Goals**: Your goal is to create a model that predicts whether two pages link together utilizing the graph data, the page descriptions, and the page type. We have provided pairs of nodes in test_edges.csv and your job is to predict whether an edge exists between these pairs of nodes.

Please report your test accuracy and any other relevant metrics/visualizations for test_labels.csv. When judging, we are interested not just in the raw performance of your algorithm in terms of test accuracy, but are also looking for interesting/novel problem-solving approaches, insightful exploratory data analysis and visualizations, possibilities for future work, and the potential challenges your model may face if deployed in a real-world setting.

**Test Accuracy: 73%**
